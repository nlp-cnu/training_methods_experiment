HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
He had normal cervical vertebral arteries .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Over the course of the first hospital day , the patient &apos;s exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
MRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
This strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
While in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
I should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
He had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
He was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
At this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
We anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po qd , Omeprazole 20mg po qd , Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid , Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic , Tylenol 650 mg po q4 prn , Colace 100 mg po bid .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Follow up will be with Dr. Tvi Fine of Neurology , and Dr. Doll Grendbly of internal medicine and primary care , shortly after discharge from rehab .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
This was considered her culprit lesion .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her left internal mammary artery was also unused .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This was intermittent .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She tolerated this well .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her medications were resumed .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
After that the patient had minimal relief of pain .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
In addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0
That has been stable .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
So that has really improved .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &apos;s hump .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her INR is 2.3 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
So if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Other major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
We put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
She is also a little dry .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient is on oxygen .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
She was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

Ms. Swanson is a 53 yo woman with PMH significant for seizure disorder , brain injury , and ? atypical multiple sclerosis who presents with right face twitch and right arm shaking .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
History is obtained from her sister , William from Lawrence General Hospital , and from her primary neurologist , Dr. Brian .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She lives in an assisted living , and was noted yesterday to have generalized tonic-clonic activity beginning on the right side and lasting 90 minutes .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
EMS gave her valium 5 mg pr at the facility and brought her to Barnstable County Hospital .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She persisted with right sided seizure activity there and was given valium 10 mg and ativan 1 mg , as well as loaded with dilantin 1000 mg .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
She was transferred to the Providence Behavioral Health Hospital CMED .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Here she was given an additional valium 5 mg x 2 and ativan 1 mg x 3 for persistent twitching in her face and right hand .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Since the ativan , her facial twitching has apparently improved , but she continues to have hand twitches .	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She also had an EEG , which showed left sided slowing on preliminary read .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Apparently she has a long history of seizure disorder , possibly from a history of traumatic brain injury ( though per Dr. Paula , 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
records from that hospitalization indicate she may have only had a very mild injury ) and has been managed on dilantin and keppra .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Since she has seen Dr. Ollie , she has had at least two episodes of status epilepticus and one generalized seizure , as well as some less significant seizures which are characterized by left gaze preference and left sided tonic-clonic activity .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Her dilantin levels had been somewhat difficult to control .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He tried adding lamictal , but this caused a rash .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
At the time of her last visit ( 2015-03-18 ) Dr. Bradley had discussed the addition of a third Castelluccio , possibly zonegran ( less likely topamax ), to the dilantin 200 mg bid and keppra 1500 mg bid .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her sister had wanted to keep the current course because she felt she was doing well where she was living and did not want to upset that .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , she had several dilantin levels drawn since her last visit , with 15.4 in 05 - 23.5 in Theresa , and 3.09 - 18 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her sister reports that the medication dose had been changed to 200 mg qam and 100 mg qpm in Theresa , and a review of her Union Hospital - North Shore Medical Center records indicates that this may have occurred in an urgent care appointment secondary to slurred speech and a recent fall and a non-trough level of 15.9 .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
According to her sister , the patient has no short-term memory .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She has been living in an assisted living facility and frequently calls her even right after she has left without remembering her visit .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient walks with a walker at baseline and goes out for dinner and shopping with her sister .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ms. Swanson also carries a diagnosis of " atypical MS ", which she brought with her to Dr. Billie .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
According to Dr. Nicole , she has had stable deficits for many years without any flare-like episodes .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
She had an MRI in 2014 that showed multiple plaque-like lesions , but these were entirely stable since 2010 .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
She is not undergoing any treatment .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Reportedly she has been evaluated at Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children , HealthSouth Braintree Rehab Hospital , and possibly St. Elizabeth's Medical Center of Boston .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She has not had an LP as far as Dr. Ginger knows .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

CT HEAD FINDINGS : There is moderately severe , confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity surrounding the frontal horns , posterior horns , and more superiorly , involving the centra semiovale .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
These findings are unchanged from prior studies , and may relate to the " atypical " demyelinating process , suggested in the indication on the prior MRI ; however , they are non-specific .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
There is no evidence of acute intra - or extra - axial hemorrhage .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There is no shift of normally midline structures .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The ventricles are mildly prominent , but are unchanged from the prior study .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There is no interval loss of focal gray - white matter differentiation to suggest acute infarction , though CT is not sensitive in the early stages .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
No focal masses is seen .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
IMPRESSION :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1) No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect ; no significant interval change from CT of 2015-07-20 .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
2) Diffuse , confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity , which may relate to an underlying demyelinating process ( as suggested in the indication provided for the prior MRI ).	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
The markedly low - attenation ( 14-15 HU ) centered within this process suggests either irreversible demyelination with cavitation (" black hole "), or lacunar infarction on a vascular basis .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Generalized and marked callosal atrophy ( on the MR ) also suggest advanced , irreversible disease .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
3) No mass is appreciated on this limited non-contrast study ; if clinically concerned , an MRI with gadolinium is recommended .	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0
MRI : There is a similar configuration of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres , suggesting demyelinating disease .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
As previously noted , there is associated volume loss , thinning of the corpus callosum , and slight widening of the ventricles .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On post-contrast images , there is a probably stable appearance of a 5 mm linear , focal area of enhancement in the left centrum semiovale , of uncertain etiology .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Also ehancing is 3 mm linear lesion in the left hippocampal cortex anteriorly , not seen on the 08-20 MR , but that study was very motion - degraded .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The hippocampus would be a most unusual site for involvement by multiple sclerosis .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There is no apparent mass lesion or mass effect .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

IMPRESSION :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1. Stable appearance of confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter , consistent with severe demyelinating disease .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2. Enhancing lesions in the left centrum semiovale and also left hippocampal cortex .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This former lesion was evident on MR dating back to 2014-08-15 , though is more prominent at this time , likely due to less motion degradation of the current scan .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Etiology of these enhancing lesions is uncertain , but could be atypical manifestations of demyelination .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
EEG :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of generalized theta and delta slowing .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Facial twitching was described by the technologist and seen on the video .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
This is primarily right-sided , facial movement clinically and did not appear to involve the forehead or CMED CSRU .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There were no clear EEG correlate .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
ABNORMALITY #2: The background voltages were occasionally lower on the left side , and there were additional bursts of delta slowing  seen broadly on the left side alone .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
ABNORMALITY #3: The background rhythms were dominated by much faster beta rhythm .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
They appeared to reach an 8 Hz frequency on the right at times , though the background was disorganized and slow on both sides for 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
much of the recording .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION : Could not be performed .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
SLEEP : No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
CARDIAC MONITOR : Showed a generally regular rhythm .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
IMPRESSION : Abnormal portable EEG due to the bursts of generalized slowing and additional left-sided slowing and voltage dimunition , along with some slowing of the background .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The generalized and background features indicate a wide-spread encephalopathy .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The left sided slowing and voltage reduction surpassed an additional dysfunction on the left side , possibly wide-spread cortical dysfunction .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
There is a possibility of a structural lesion on the left , but the encephalopathy dominated the overall picture .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There were no clear epileptiform discharges .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
No EEG correlate was established for the facial twitching .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The lack of EEG correlate to the facial twitching does not exclude a central cause ( and , indeed , this appeared most likely based on the clinical and video observations ).	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

53 yo woman with h/o seizure disorder , demyelinating disease , and brain injury , presents with prolonged seizure , now unresponsive with persistent twitching of right arm and face .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This is most consistent with complex partial seizures with a focus in the left hemisphere , most likely the motor strip .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In the past , her seizures were on the left side , which implies that she now has a new focus .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It is possible that this is secondary to her underlying demyelinating disease , but per report this has not been very active .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Other possibilities include infection , including her UTI .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
It is likely that these seizures began due to subtherapeutic dilantin levels on her new dose of 200 mg / 100 mg .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
Her seizure management is difficult , given the higher doses were causing her to fall and slur her speech .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Discussed with Dr. Joaquin the addition of an alternate Castelluccio with the possibility of tapering down the dilantin in the future , and he agreed that she may benefit from zonegran .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Cannot use lamictal or depakote due to reactions .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Topamax is another possibility , but not ideal in a patient with preexisting cognitive deficits .	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
She was started on zonegran at 50 mg daily with plans to increase by 50 mg every other week to a goal dose of 200 mg / day ; she was on 100 mg daily at discharge and should have her dose increased on 10-12 and again on 10-26 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She was continued on keppra and dilantin with trough checked frequently and adjustment as needed .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ativan was used for breakthrough seizures ( facial twitching ).	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
MRI/MRA showed new temporal lesions , but it is unclear if these are the cause or effect of her seizures .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
She will need to have a repeat MRI in several months for further evaluation .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
LP was done and had no changes to suggest a different etiology ( ie negative cytology and negative immunophenotyping ).	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Oligoclonal bands were not assessed as there was not enough CSF per the laboratory .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She will need repeated dilantin troughs with one time dose when trough is subtherapeutic .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

2. atypical MS : discussed with her outpt neurologist ( Dr. Ford in Boston Medical Center ); no current role for MS medications .	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
MRI was performed and showed new lesions vs sz effects in the left temporal lobe .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
She also had a new lesion on her last MRI in the centrum semiovale .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
LP was done to evaluate for malignancy , and no malignant cells were seen .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
Immunotyping was negative as well ( per verbal report ).	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Unfortunately , oligoclonal bands could not be sent from the CSF ( lab sent CSF for other studies and there was not enough left over for OCB s).	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This was relayed to the family ( Kirk ).	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Given that she does have new lesions on MRI , if OCB s were sent this would have weighed in in her dx of MS , and it's possible she could benefit from MS therapy .	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
This was relayed to the family , and they will readdress this with Dr. Ford ( MS Hoyos ).	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The family is confident in any decision Dr. Ford would make re : therapy for her MS .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This lowered with IV nitroglycerin .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The situation was reviewed with his wife , Sligh .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the Leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He stabilized over the weekend .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
He developed epigastric pain on 07/31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. Slusslashgodle , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On 08/02/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He had good hemodynamics .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He had a right bundle branch block .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1

1. CARDIOVASCULAR :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was admitted for complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure which could be consistent with angina .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
However , given the long duration of the symptoms and negative workup in the past , it was thought to be unlikely .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , the patient was started on an aspirin as well as a beta blocker , and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol was initiated .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A stress thallium was planned for the day following admission .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , on the night of admission the patient was found lying in her bed diaphoretic and obtunded , and a code was called .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Further examination revealed a strong palpable pulse with a systolic blood pressure in the 130 s and a heart rate in the 80 s.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Over the course of the next few minutes the patient became increasingly more responsive .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She was treated with a fluid bolus .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient quickly responded to a fluid bolus and became interactive .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She reported that she was sitting on the commode urinating and began to feel nauseous and presyncopal .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She was able to get to bed at which point she passed out .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She denied any chest pain or pressure , and no shortness of breath during this event .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A rhythm check obtained during the time of this event demonstrated a pause of six seconds followed by a junctional escape rhythm .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
An electrocardiogram obtained after the code demonstrated no acute changes .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Her acute bradycardic event was felt likely secondary to her new beta blocker in conjunction with a vagal response .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
It was determined to stop the beta blocker , and atropine was placed at the bedside .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On the following day the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated dilated right ventricle secondary to chronic dysfunction and a pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 100 .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
Her stress test was cancelled .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A CT angiogram was ordered to evaluate for chronic thromboembolic disease as a potential cause of her pulmonary hypertension .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of normal enzymes and continued to be monitored on telemetry .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
A Pulmonary consultation was obtained to evaluate for possible etiology of the patient 's hypotension .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There was little evidence to suggest any cardiac disease , and given the patient 's Grave's disease an autoimmune process was felt to be possible .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
In addition , consideration was given to sarcoidosis , human immunodeficiency virus , and drug-induced given her history of herbal medication use .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It was recommended that the patient begin anticoagulation given the severity of her pulmonary hypertension .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
It was also planned to undergo a right heart catheterization with a vasodilation trial by the catheterization laboratory .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A right heart catheterization was performed on 2014-12-05 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator challenge was performed with a positive response .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In addition , a CT angiogram of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol showed no intravascular filling defect but did show a right upper lobe ground-glass and scattered adenopathy .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Therefore , in the end left atrial hypertension was essentially ruled out as a primary cause .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Chronic pulmonary embolus was less likely given her negative CT angiogram .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Chronic lung disease was unlikely given the patient 's normal pulmonary function tests and DLCO in 2012 as well as a normal CT angiogram .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Collagen vascular disease could not be definitively ruled out ; however , given the patient 's lack of connective tissue disorder stigmata it was thought to be less likely , and the patient 's human immunodeficiency virus test was negative .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Therefore , it was felt that the patient was most likely experiencing a primary pulmonary hypertension .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Consideration was given to treating the patient with a course of calcium channel blocker ; however , given the patient 's poor response to Lopressor , it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient 's pulmonary hypertension .	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
Therefore , her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of Flolan as a treatment .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Plans were made for placement of a Hickman catheter and initiation of Flolan treatment .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , on 12-07 , the patient once again experienced an episode of unresponsiveness .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Upon arrival by the physician the patient was awake , alert , and oriented with a pulse in the 80 s, with pressure in the 80 s, and satting 100% on room air .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She described this episode as an uncomfortable feeling in her chest .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was treated with 2 liters of intravenous fluids with a bump in her systolic blood pressure to the 90 s.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Review of telemetry revealed an 8 to 9 beat episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia followed by an episode of bradycardia to 60 beats per minute .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear , but was felt likely secondary to the patient 's tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear pulmonary hypertension , was very preload dependent , and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular compression by a dilated left ventricle .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Given the patient 's persistent hypotensive episodes , and decreased urine output , she was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management prior to initiation of Flolan therapy .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On 12-08 , the Hickman catheter was placed in preparation of Flolan administration .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
During the Mass. Mental Health Center Medical Intensive Care Unit stay , the patient was found to exquisitely preload dependent and responded well to aggressive fluids as needed to maintain her blood pressure with a systolic of greater than 90 .	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She had no further episodes of bradycardia during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In addition , the patient 's urine output improved dramatically with hydration therapy , suggesting her low urine output was secondary to decreased cardiac output secondary to low preload .	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The patient continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service , who determined that the patient was demonstrating severe vasal sensitivity with bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
This was to be deferred until after the patient had her Hickman in place .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Because the patient 's pulmonary pressures responded so well to adenosine during right heart catheterization , it was thought that the patient would be a good candidate for Flolan therapy .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Flolan was initiated on 12-08 at 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was monitored for symptoms of Flolan therapy including nausea , vomiting , first bite jaw claudication , or hypotension .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
Over the course of the hospital stay the patient 's Flolan dose was titrated to receive maximum benefit without precipitating symptoms of Flolan overdose .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was felt to be stable on her current Flolan dose and was therefore transferred back to the floor .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A high resolution CT was requested to further evaluate for possible secondary cause of her primary pulmonary hypertension ; however , the patient refused it at this time .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Plans for placement of a pacemaker were initiated .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , on the night prior to the planned surgical date the patient suffered an episode of bleeding from her Hickman catheter site .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Surgery was notified and pressure was applied ; however , it did not stop oozing .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A surgicel dressing was placed and prolonged pressure resulted in resolution of the bleeding .	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In addition , an extra stitch was placed in an effort to stop the bleeding .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Following this episode the patient felt like she was " too stressed " for pacemaker placement .	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Therefore , she was monitored over the next few days for any further bleeding events .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Over the course of the next few days the patient became more accustomed to her Flolan , and Flolan teaching was continued .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She continued to have occasional episodes of dizziness , shortness of breath , and hypotension whenever the alarm sounded suggesting that the Flolan bag needed to be changed .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
However , over the course of the hospital stay these decreased both in frequency and severity .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On 12-15 , the patient went for placement of a pacemaker .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She had dual-mode , dual-pacing , dual-sensing pacemaker placed with a lower rate at 60 ppm , and upper rate of 120 ppm with a paced AV of 150 msec .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Brief Hospital Course :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient is a 83 yo man with a history of past intracranial hemorrhages ( most recent 07-01 with R-frontal hemorrhage ) who presented with gradually slowing of mentation and increased gait instability since one week .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
On initial exam the patient was not oriented to time , seemed somewhat slow , and had difficulties generating a list of animals .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
His cranial nerves and strength were full , and the sensory exam showed mildly decreased vibration and proprioception in both LE , suggesting peripheral neuropathy .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
A CT was performed in the Deanna that showed a new significant R-frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the same location as the prior bleed .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The patient was seen by both neurology and neurosurgery , and the two teams agreed that the etiology seemed to be related to underlying amyloidosis .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
During the last admission the question of a mass underlying a hemorrhage in the R-frontal region was raised .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The location of the hemorrhage was not felt to be typical for hypertensive bleed ( cortical ) and it was felt to be unlikely that the recent fall was related to the bleed .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient could not undergo an MRI due to his pacer .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was admitted to the neurology ICU for closer monitoring and was stable overnight - BP was initially elevated and required a labetalol drip for < 24 hours , then stabilized .	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
The goal SBP of < 150 was achieved .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Coags and UA were checked and were normal .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
For the question of seizure activity associated with a cortical bleed , he was started prophylactically on Keppra ( given questionable allergy to dilantin ) , at 500 mg bid ; no seizure activity was seen .	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1
This medication should be continued as an outpatient at least while the bleed has time to clear up , with planned titration up to 1000 mg bid on 04-05 .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Head CT repeated on 03-30 was unchanged , and the patient remained stable with only very suble focal exam findings ( very mild right pronator drift ) as well as his persistently poor memory related to dementia .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The plan after 24 hours was to transfer him to the floor , but the hospital was full and he never got a bed .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Cardiovascularly , lipitor and amiodarone were continued .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He could not get an MRI due to his pacemaker .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There were no telemetry events , and he ruled out by enzyme .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Pulmonlologically , his chest xray was negative and he complained of no breathing problems .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Endocrinologically , BG was monitored to improve outcome in ICU setting though he had no history of DM .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Of note , Hba1c done 03-04 was slightly elevated ( " borderline DM " ) at 6.3 ; this was repeated and was still pending on the day of discharge .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
Ins / outs and electrolytes were monitored and were not abnormal ; he was on a bowel regimen , VD boots and PUD prophylaxis with protonix during the admission .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Walking was assessed later and the patient was unstable on his feet .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
PT was asked to see him for this gait problem .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Brandon felt well and was seen by PT who suggested a rehab/Hahnemann Hospital ( Worcester ) to work on walking with the eventual goal of returning to assisted living with his wife when walking improved .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Follow-up was arranged with neurosurgery in 5-6 weeks with repeat head ct to be arranged by neurosurgery office to make sure blood has cleared , and if indicated , to look for a possible underlying lesion ( although unlikely ) .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12/16/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
This required a transplant nephrectomy .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
A pulmonary arteriogram on 01/03/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12/19/97 .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01/06/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
The patient remained unstable .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on 01/08/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Nonetheless , Mr. Less continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. Less condition was irretrievable .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Dr. Cantsleddjesc felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on 1/16/98 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Hospital course by system :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1. Cardiovascular :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
However , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This responded to fluid bolus .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 &apos;s or 70 &apos;s was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Clearly , the patient &apos;s hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2. Infectious Disease :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
She continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
She was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her urine legionella antigen was negative .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She was started on vancomycin for this .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
These bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
She had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3. GI :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
GI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
Her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4. Shortness of breath :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
As mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
At most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
This was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
5. Derm :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
She was started on some Miconazole Cream .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mr. Stain was transferred from the Oreiewlefell Merkane I Penaltbridgesgreat University Medical Center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
His only positive result was a sputum culture for Pseudomonas and this came after he had already been on antibiotics .	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The physical examination on transfer showed an alert male with temperature 100 degrees , blood pressure 120/64 , heart rate 80 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was intubated with pressor support of 25 , and PEEP of 12.5 with 70% FIO2 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Tracheostomy tube was in good position .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There was an audible air leak .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His chest showed bilateral rhonchi .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The abdomen was distended with active bowel sounds .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The rectal examination was unremarkable .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Extremities showed trace pulmonary edema .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
LABORATORY DATA :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates , greater in the lower lung fields than in the upper .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 83 , with an 11 degree axis , non-specific ST-T wave changes .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The sputum Gram stain showed a few polys and no organisms .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , pCO2 of 48 and pH of 7.47 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
HOSPITAL COURSE :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it .	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
He also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas he was known to have .	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
The steroids were tapered .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was also begun on anti-Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
Because of the story of hemoptysis , he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner &apos;s and Goodpasture &apos;s .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
These results were all negative .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He continued to require very high FIO2 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was found to have a DVT by ultrasound .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
He underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
He stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
At that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

HOSPITAL COURSE :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
# 1. cerebrovascular accident .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
This was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
Previous echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Her Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It is discontinued at the time of transport .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
During evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
At the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient &apos;s family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
As I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
These tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
I will be happy to furnish the results .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient has a history of MI in 1989 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
EKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It has been evaluated in the past without success .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
During her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Florinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
CT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient has glaucoma .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

HOSPITAL COURSE :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1. HYPOGLYCEMIA :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient had been initially very hypoglycemic on admission secondary to overdosing on insulin ; however , with glucose repletion both in the Emergency Department and in the ICU , this resolved and the patient also began to eat .	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
We checked fingerstick glucoses q.i.d. and at 3:00 a.m.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His glucose on the morning of discharge was about 60 so we opted to decrease his p.m. NPH dose slightly for discharge and continue covering him with sliding scale insulin .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He should also continue having a snack at midnight if able .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It is likely that he required a much greater amount of insulin as an outpatient due to poor compliance with Richard Natalie diet .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2. ALCOHOL ABUSE :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It is likely that the patient continues to drink more than he admits .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He did have past alcoholism consisting of a half a pint of brandy per day for three years but supposedly had quit in 2009-09-03 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He had been on a diazepam CIWA scale prophylaxis against DT s; however , he had a very low CIWA scale during his entire admission and did not need any benzodiazepines .	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
This alcohol abuse may be further addressed as an inpatient on the Psychiatry Quincy Medical Center .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We had also requested a Social Work consult regarding this .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3. DEPRESSION vs. Borderline personality disorder :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient has had several admissions in the past for attempted suicide with overdose of his insulin and though he denied at this time attempting to end his life , it appears that the social situation of increased stressors corresponding to this time suggest that this is not the truth .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
He received a one-to-one sitter during his admission and will be transferred to the Psychiatry HealthSouth New England Rehab Hospital to ensure the patient 's safety and initiate further antidepressant treatment .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He will need close follow-up regarding his depression as an outpatient , although apparently this has been set up for him in the past and he had not followed through .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4. HISTORY OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His blood pressure was fairly low with a maximum of 130s systolic during his admission , thus we did not continue his lisinopril which he had been on in the past .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5. RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We obtained a right upper quadrant ultrasound as well as LFTs , amylase , and lipase which were all normal .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He had no evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones or any abnormalities with the liver or kidneys .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
it is possible that he has had a muscle strain or other musculoskeletal cause .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
6. PROPHYLAXIS :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was put on Pepcid for GI prophylaxis .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
7. FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES , AND NUTRITION :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He complied with Linda Chad diet while hospitalized .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was hyperphosphatemic secondary to overadministration of Neutra-Phos during his ICU stay .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
He was given two doses of calcium carbonate 1 gram , and will most likely normalize secondary to both calcium binding and urinary excretion .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He has been asymptomatic .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1) NEUROLOGY :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
3) PULMONARY :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
4) HEMATOLOGY :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
At that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The patient was then continued by report on Dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient apparently did well until June 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
A ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
By report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However the patient was then subsequently transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was evaluated by Dr. Rhalt of Dentvailr. Medical Center .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
As the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
There was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
At the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1
Subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
A number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
At this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
These drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
