Brief Hospital Course :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mr. Lockley was admitted with respiratory failure , thought to be related to mucus plugging as well as a pseudomonal pneumonia .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Both of these etiologies were treated , and he continued to oxygenate and ventilate well on his usual ventilator settings .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , the issue that dominated the admission was his recent acute decline in mental status .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was thoroughly evaluated by neurology and underwent head CT , MRI , LP , and EEG .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This work-up demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct , likely cardioembolic .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
However , they felt this event could not account for his new , severe global deficit ; this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process , likely anoxic encephalopathy , for which the prognosis is extremely grim .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
This was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient 's wife , son , primary care doctor , ICU attending , and neurology consultant in the presence of a Asian interpreter .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The end result of these discussion was that the patient 's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery ; the family decided to make him comfort measures only .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped , and he expired shortly thereafter .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

HOSPITAL COURSE :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1. Hypotension - The patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Upon admission it was unclear whether or not the patient was volume overloaded or volume depleted .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Initially he was treated with intravenous fluids with a dramatic response in his systolic blood pressure .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , subsequent it was determined that the patient 's hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Therefore the focus of treatment was changed to controlling his rate .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient 's Digoxin had been weaned off prior to his admission .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The patient was loaded once again with Digoxin and his beta blocker was increased to 100 mg of Lopressor , three times a day .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In addition the patient was started on Verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s .	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
3. Congestive heart failure - During the initial course of the patient 's admission , it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids , however , subsequently he was diuresed when he became symptomatic and short of breath .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Chest x-rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient 's heart failure .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
In addition , plans were made to evaluate the patient 's cardiac arteries to determine if he had any component of ischemic cardiomyopathy .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4. Abnormal liver function tests - The patient had an isolated , elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis , however , an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
There was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Again seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The patient also revealed a prior history of heavy alcohol use for approximately 20 years , during the mid 1950s to mid 1970s .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
It was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
5. Fall - The patient had a mechanical fall during his admission .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was walking in the hall , dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He fell backwards , landing on his buttocks and bumped his head .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
A computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
6. Rectal bleeding - The patient has a history of rectal bleeding , ever since his brachytherapy for his prostate cancer .	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
The patient has been treated with Argon laser therapy in the past for his rectal bleeding and it is recommended that he follow up with his gastroenterologist for repeat Argon laser therapy .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Just prior to discharge on 11-14 , pt 's BP was found to be 70/40 P70 s just after receiving her am BP meds .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She was asymptomatic .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was kept in the hospital and the following issues were addressed :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1. Hypotension : The patient 'd pm BP meds were held 11-14 and she was administered 1.5L NS over the course of the day with subsequent SBP s in the high 90 s, low 100 s,.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
The hypotension was likely due to volume depletion caused by her diarrhea / loose stools in addition to decreased PO intake secondary to her GERD and thrush .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
All of this occurred in the setting of aggressive BP management with metoprolol 25 BID , HCTZ / Triampterene ( as a replacment for lasix due to recurrent hypokalemia ), Benicar 20 mg QD , and Imdur 30 mg QD .	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Infection / sepsis was not likely given she was afebrile and had no localizing sx with an improving lung exam and 02 requirement .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Given the patient 's recent RP bleed , there was concern for a recurrent bleed .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Her groin exam was unchanged .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her Hct dropped from Hct 38.9 before fluids to 35.5 s/p 1.5L NS and was thought to be dilutional .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Repeat hcts were stable .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was kept an additional two days to follow her hcts and titrate her BP meds .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
As volume depletion was thought to be the cause of her low BP , only the BBlocker was restarted .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
She was also placed on on low dose spironolactone as a K sparing diuretic and for BP control in addition to Toprol XL 25 mg QD for her coronary disease .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
She tolerated these meds with SBP s in the high 90 s to 100 s and was therefore discharged on this regimen .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
She will need follow up with her PCP within B week after discharge from the extended care facility for further BP titration and monitoring of her electrolytes .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2. Thrush : This is likely secondary to her steroid inhalers and PO prednisone for COPD exacerbation .	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
She was started on nystatin swish and swallow QID .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was encouraged to take PO liquids to prevent volume depletion .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
3. diarrhea : The patient has been having loose stools at night and was guiac pos x 2 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Stool for C.diff toxin was sent x 1 and was negative .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Her bowel regimen is prn .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Gastroenteritis is possible but she has no vomiting and only occ nausea with meds .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
There is no evidence of obstruction on AXR .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Therefore , the cause of her mild diarrhea ( few loose BM / liquid stool / night ) may be either viral or secondary to resolving abdominal hematoma with resultant irritation of GI system .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
We have advised a BRAT diet .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
4. guiac pos stool : Given the patient 's sx of GERD , current PO steroid regimen , and ASA for her stents , the ddx for her guiac positive stools would include gastritis / gastric ulcer in addition to lower GI pathology .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
However , she has no vomiting and only mild nausea with medications .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
She also has no gross blood per rectum and her hct is stable .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

HOSPITAL COURSE :	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
He was given supplemental oxygen .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
On 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
On 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
No other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Patient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

The patient &apos;s abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Clinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
He underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
His pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
As he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
