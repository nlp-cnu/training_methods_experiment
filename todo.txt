- Goals:
	Refactor the convoluted project directory structure, 
	Make sure I can run the dataset conversions in one command,
	Finish dataset conversion scripts,
	Learn rockin around the christmas tree on the guitar,

- Problems:
	Rocking around is hard
	n2c2 dataset conversion is a pain in the ass
	Still not crystal clear how to get dataset conversions to go all at once. I think the current solution might work when all the dataset conversions are done

- Accomplished
	Refactored the current project into something a little more sensible. It might feel cluttered, but until I have permissions to run subprocesses this is it
	Mostly done with the new i2b2 conversion
	Almost done with the n2c2 conversion


--- 12/11/2022
- Goals:
	Finish the i2b2 conversion
	Finish the n2c2 conversion
	Download and start the Onto data conversion
	Create mini-datasets of all the datasets

- Problems:
	I still cannot get this stupid fucking Onto data. I'm waiting until they notify me I can download it from their webservice

- Accomplished:
	Finished the i2b2 conversion
	Finished the n2c2 conversion
	Got a really good idea for the 1-click conversion of all the datasets; seems to work when initially testing :)
	Created a script to get all of the little datasets for testing.

- Goals:
	Complete refactoring of project directory structure. This will be the final
	Validate the 1-click dataset conversion script
	Validate the mini-dataset script, combine it with the dataset conversion
	Write most of experiment 1

- Problems:
	Still not quite there with experiment 1, have a confounding (truly stupifying) error in the Datagenerator

- Accomplished:
	Refactor complete, things are where they ought to be and all is well
	The 1-click conversion script runs and works for all of the domain-specific datasets
	The mini-dataset script works and is integrated with the dataset_conversion
	Made some headway on experiment 1, particularly with validating the label preprocessing


--- 12/13/2022
- Goals:
	Finish writing experiment 1 and validate it
	Run experiment 1 with domain-specific data
	Gather the Onto dataset
	Start conversion script for the onto data (this is going to have to be pruned)
	Write experiment 2

-Problems
	I'm a fuckcing problem
	Experiment 1 runs, but the micro-f1 score doesn't seem quite right, but I'm running it overnight to test how long I expect this to run
	Onto notes is now available online but I haven't gotten it yet
	Did not quite get to experiment 2, but I think I learned some things that will make writing it easier

- Accomplished
	Got most of experiment 1 written, and it mechanically works
